# BetterSave

Improves local level saving by saving each created level as an individual `.gmd` file rather than dumping everything in `CCLocalLevels`. Should result in a significant decrease in level save times, as well as lessen the likelihood of the game crashing while saving.

Levels are saved in `<GD save dir>/levels`.

Also includes a trashcan system, where levels are placed in a trashcan before being permanently deleted.
